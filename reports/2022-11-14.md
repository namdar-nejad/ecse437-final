### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

* *Uncentainty about how to draw protocol models (the given examples were pretty different from our system)*
* *For certain aspects of the models, a lot of us were uncertain with the data of our models.*
* *Creating UML models are way harder than acutal coding.*
* *The models for milestone 4 were much harder to complete than expected due to confusion between client and server*
* *The models for splendor was quite different from the examples because it required models for client as well*


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

* *Reviewing the examples in the notes and the examples we went through in class is key to fully understand the theory*
* *Things that look easy on the surface might actually be way harder than it seems*
* *Working in groups for the milestones makes certain tasks easier to complete*
* *We need to call more often to work faster*
