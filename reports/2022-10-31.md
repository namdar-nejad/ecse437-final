### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

* *JavaFx and Scene builder was harder to learn and work with than expected*
* *Working on a short timeline while sharing code is difficult, especially when you can't work on one part without another*
* Getting confortable with a framework can be very time consuming.
* *We didn't set the exact time to have our meeting, so the meeting had to be done without me*

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

* *Learning to use all the necessary tools to complete the project will be very time consuming*
* *Meet with group as early as possible to plan work to mitigate code sharing issues as much as possible*
* Working in collaboration can be somewhat efficient and having multiple meetings to see where we're at definitely helps.


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
* *Difficulty having two separate scenes communicate between each other*
* *Cannot make two windows communicate with eachother*
